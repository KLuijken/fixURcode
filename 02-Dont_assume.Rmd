# Don't assume anything!

- Check the variable or file names.
- Check the object content and type.
- Check code that you think was working fine just a minute ago and you are certain you haven't touched.
- Check whether the online example you modeled your code after actually works.
- Check your environment
- Check the function documentation, whether it really works the way you thought it would.
- Write a test to confirm expected behaviour.
